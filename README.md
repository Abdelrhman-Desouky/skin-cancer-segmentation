# Skin-Cancer-Segmentation
This project is about semantic segmentation of X-ray images for skin cancer cases .<br>
I applied U-NET architecture for Semantic segmentation using tensorflow framework using this paper [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).<br>
Also applied Pix2Pix Generation using this paper [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004v3).<br>
The dataset used for this project [Skin cancer: HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajghuwalewala/ham1000-segmentation-and-classification).<br>
